Plinkoo Game ðŸŽ®
An interactive and engaging Plinkoo game inspired by Stake, featuring dynamic gameplay, real-time physics, and a visually appealing design. This project combines modern frontend and backend technologies to deliver a secure and responsive user experience.

Key Features
Dynamic Gameplay: Real-time physics and animations provide an immersive experience.
Secure Backend Logic: Ensures tamper-proof gameplay and dynamic ball positioning.
Responsive Design: Optimized for multiple devices with a seamless user interface.
Scalable Architecture: Built with modular components for future enhancements.
Tech Stack
Frontend:

React.js: For dynamic UI development.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and maintainable code.
Tailwind CSS: For sleek and responsive styling.
Canvas Tag: Utilized for rendering real-time physics and visual elements.
Backend:

Node.js & Express.js: To handle API logic and secure gameplay mechanics.
Axios: For efficient frontend-backend communication.
How It Works
Players drop a ball into a pegboard.
The ball interacts with obstacles (pegs) rendered on the <canvas> tag using real-time physics.
The backend ensures the gameplay logic is secure and results are dynamically calculated.
